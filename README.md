# Mapping_Earthquakes by Ketaki
 This project helps build a webpage to visualize the earthquake data using geoJSON data and Leaflet.js libraries. There are three different map styles(Streets,Satellite and Dark) and three data layers delivered using Overlay layers and LayerGroup functions. 
 - You can toggle between the different layers to view the different map styles along with the techtonic plate and major and all earthquake data.
 - The data is obtained from USGS website and maps provided by the APIs from MapBox.
